# Ignore rules that conflict with black or that we consciously relax:
# - E203, W503: known conflicts with black's formatting
# - E501: line length (we trust max-line-length + black)
# - E401, E402: multiple imports on one line / import position
# - E741: ambiguous variable name (e.g. I, l, O) – allowed in legacy / math-ish code
